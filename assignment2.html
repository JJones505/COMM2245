<h2>Profile</h2>
Jesse Jones, a New Mexico native, was raised in the small village of Pecos. The abundant history and beautiful landscape of Pecos piqued Jesse’s interest and imagination as a child, learning of the Indian tribes, Spanish settlers and civil war soldiers. This eventually became my inspiration to capture the true beauty of New Mexico. I earned my bachelors in University Studies with an emphasis in Photojournalism at the University of New Mexico. I am graduating this summer with a Multimedia Journalism degree from UNM. I specialize in event, portraiture and landscape photography.
