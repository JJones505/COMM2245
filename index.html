Profile
Jesse Jones, a New Mexico native, was raised in the small village of Pecos. The abundant history and beautiful landscape of Pecos piqued Jesse’s interest and imagination as a child, learning of the Indian tribes, Spanish settlers and civil war soldiers. This eventually became my inspiration to capture the true beauty of New Mexico. I earned my bachelors in University Studies with an emphasis in Photojournalism at the University of New Mexico. I am graduating this summer with a Multimedia Journalism degree from UNM. I specialize in event, portraiture and landscape photography.


Professional Experience 

Most recently, I participated in this year’s New Mexico Press Association workshop during its’ annual convention. As a team, we created a print publication that was accompanied by online elements.  

Prior to that, I interned as a photo editor at Outside the Magazine in 2005. It was not as fast paced as I imagine a newsroom is but it was challenging and I learned a great deal how magazine publishing works. 
I believe my greatest strength is photography, I was fortunate enough to have excellent photojournalist and photo art instructors / mentors at UNM. I feel my writing is getting better with every story I write. I do have experience with handheld and mobile video and I created a podcast for a class.

The Adobe programs I know are, Photoshop, Lightroom, Audition, InDesign, Premier and Rush.
